### üìÑ Project Description

**Emotion-Aware Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational agent that can detect human emotions from text in real-time.  
It uses a pre-trained transformer model to classify emotions such as **joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise**, and **neutral**.

Based on the detected emotion, it responds empathetically to enhance user interaction. This chatbot has applications in:
- Mental health support  
- Emotion-aware customer service  
- Human-computer interaction systems  

**Key Features:**
- Real-time emotion detection
- Emotion-based chatbot responses
- Simple and interactive Streamlit UI

### üîö Conclusion & Future Plan

This Emotion-Aware Chatbot demonstrates how deep learning can be used to build empathetic communication tools.  
In future versions, we plan to:
- Support multi-language emotion detection  
- Integrate voice input and output  
- Connect with mental health professionals for feedback
